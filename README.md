# ML-Correctness-prediction

Build machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions and other students’ responses.

Algorithms involved:
1. k-Nearest Neighbor using sklearn.
2. Item Response Theory.
3. Neural Networks using PyTorch.
4. Bagging ensemble
5. Adaboost using NN as base classifier.
